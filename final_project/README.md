## Udacity Data Visualization Course - Final Project

# Summary

I develop an interactive resume application while taking Udacity course - JavaScript Basic. This application reads my resume content from a JSON file and dynamically displays that content within a provided template. I use objects, functions, conditionals, and control structures to compose the content that display on the resume.

# Design



# Feedback

Implemented with JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, css, HTML and google map API.
