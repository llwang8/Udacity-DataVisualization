The yellow routes seem to have a tinge of grey in them, as they are as not as bright as yellow can be. Consequently, routes become London's skeleton, an outline of the city and its cycle usage.</p></div><section class="post-menu-area clearfix"><nav class="post-controls clearfix"><div class="actions"><button class="widget-button like-count highlight-action" aria-label="you and 1 other person liked this post" title="you and 1 other person liked this post">2 Likes</button><button class="widget-button toggle-like has-like fade-out no-text" aria-label="undo like" title="undo like"><i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true" style="text-indent: 1px; transform: scale(1);"></i></button><button class="widget-button share no-text" aria-label="share a link to this post" title="share a link to this post" data-share-url="/t/communicating-with-color/16152/13?u=wangxbl56" data-post-number="13"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></button><button class="widget-button show-more-actions no-text" aria-label="show more" title="show more"><i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h" aria-hidden="true"></i></button><button class="widget-button reply create fade-out" aria-label="begin composing a reply to this post" title="begin composing a reply to this post"><i class="fa fa-reply" aria-hidden="true"></i>Reply</button></div></nav></section></div><section class="post-actions"></section><div class="post-links-container"></div></div></div></article></div><div class="topic-post clearfix regular" id="" style="min-height: 820px"><article id="post_14" data-post-id="80226" data-user-id="65868" class="boxed onscreen-post"><a href="https://discussions.udacity.com/t/communicating-with-color/16152/18" class="tabLoc"></a><div class="row"><div class="topic-avatar"><a class="trigger-user-card main-avatar" href="https://discussions.udacity.com/users/Arnaud" data-user-card="Arnaud"><img alt="" width="45" height="45" src="./worldOilReserve_files/150810_1.png" title="Arnaud" class="avatar"></a><div class="poster-avatar-extra"></div></div><div class="topic-body clearfix"><div class="topic-meta-data"><div class="names trigger-user-card"><span class="first username"><a href="https://discussions.udacity.com/users/Arnaud" data-user-card="Arnaud">Arnaud</a></span></div><div class="post-info"><a href="https://discussions.udacity.com/t/communicating-with-color/16152/14?u=wangxbl56" data-share-url="/t/communicating-with-color/16152/14?u=wangxbl56" data-post-number="14" class="post-date"><span title="Jun 30, 2015 8:02 am" data-time="1435665723522" data-format="tiny" class="relative-date">Jun '15</span></a></div><div class="read-state read" title="Post is unread"><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></div></div><div class="regular contents"><div class="cooked"><p>I like this one:</p>

Using different shades of the same color would have been more effective. Each color encodes a country, while the size encodes the GDP of that country. I vertical bar chart with e.g. different shades of red would be more effective in conveying the message.</p>

<p>This data visualization uses color as a mapping between boxes of variable width on the top and the geographical location of the countries. The width of the boxes maps to the size of crude oil production and boxes are connected to the map location of the country by a straight line. By using colors, it is much easier for the observer to pair the boxes with the corresponding countries on the map. Similar shades of color have only been used for countries that are geographically distant, hence avoiding any potential confusions.</p></div><section class="post-menu-area clearfix"><nav class="post-controls clearfix"><div class="actions"><button class="widget-button like-count highlight-action" aria-label="3 people liked this post" title="3 people liked this post">3 Likes</button><button class="widget-button toggle-like like no-text" aria-label="like this post" title="like this post"><i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i></button><button class="widget-button share no-text" aria-label="share a link to this post" title="share a link to this post" data-share-url="/t/communicating-with-color/16152/18?u=wangxbl56" data-post-number="18"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></button><button class="widget-button show-more-actions no-text" aria-label="show more" title="show more"><i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h" aria-hidden="true"></i></button><button class="widget-button reply create fade-out" aria-label="begin composing a reply to this post" title="begin composing a reply to this post"><i class="fa fa-reply" aria-hidden="true"></i>Reply</button></div></nav></section></div><section class="post-actions"></section><div class="post-links-container"></div></div></div></article></div><div class="topic-post clearfix regular"><article id="post_19" data-post-id="99472" data-user-id="1893" class="boxed onscreen-post"><a href="https://discussions.udacity.com/t/communicating-with-color/16152/18" class="tabLoc"></a><div class="row"><div class="topic-avatar"><a class="trigger-user-card main-avatar" href="https://discussions.udacity.com/users/bhavin_329167828" data-user-card="bhavin_329167828"><img alt="" width="45" height="45" src="./worldOilReserve_files/90(2).png" title="bhavin_329167828" class="avatar"></a><div class="poster-avatar-extra"></div></div><div class="topic-body clearfix"><div class="topic-meta-data"><div class="names trigger-user-card"><span class="first username"><a href="https://discussions.udacity.com/users/bhavin_329167828" data-user-card="bhavin_329167828">bhavin_329167828</a></span></div><div class="post-info"><a href="https://discussions.udacity.com/t/communicating-with-color/16152/19?u=wangxbl56" data-share-url="/t/communicating-with-color/16152/19?u=wangxbl56" data-post-number="19" class="post-date"><span title="Aug 3, 2015 8:24 am" data-time="1438604689745" data-format="tiny" class="relative-date">Aug '15</span></a></div><div class="read-state" title="Post is unread"><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></div></div><div class="regular contents"><div class="cooked"><p>The following info graph from NY Times portraying how the liberal and conservative wings of the Supreme Court voted in close decisions, clearly indicates the wings using red and blue backgrounds in the headshot of each justice.</p>

<p>The visualization has a lot of information to convey. In my opinion, thanks in big part to the use of color, is mostly successful.
