## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
require(ggplot2)
library(ggplot2)

pf <- read.csv('world_cup.tsv', sep='\t', header = TRUE)

dim(pf)
head(pf)

```

```{r}
ggplot(pf, aes(x=year, y=attendance)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill='#339900') + ggtitle('Word Cup Attendance by Year') 

ggsave('worldCupGraph.png')

```
